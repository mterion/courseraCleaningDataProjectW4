## Information
Description
Dataset name: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

## Description of the final dataset *tidyDatSetStep5.txt*
This data set contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.

### Description:
Data in dataset contains 180 rows and 70 variables names containing the exact elements of either mean() or std()
  
The whole data set has been grouped by 
  *subject
  *activities
to give the average of each variable for each subject and activity

**Subject**
The ID of the test subject numbered sequentially from 1 to 30

 **Activity**:
The type of activity performed when the measurements were taken. The activities column has  6 types of activies : 
1. Walking
1. Walking_Upstairs
1. Walking_Downstairs
1. Sitting
1. Standing
1. Laying
